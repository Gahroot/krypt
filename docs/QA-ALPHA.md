### Status legend

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✅ PASS | Automated test green |
| ⚠️ FLAKY | Passes in isolation; fails intermittently under suite load (timing-dependent) |
| ❌ FAIL | Deterministic failure (real regression/bug) |
| 🔵 MANUAL | System exists and is wired, but has no automated test (manual QA only) |

## Automated Test Results

Captured from a fresh `pnpm -r test` (2026-06-30):

```
packages/shared:  42 files, 3347 tests — ALL PASS (vitest)
packages/client:  1 file, 8 tests — PASS (vitest + jsdom; act() warnings only)
packages/server:  test:suite runs 20 of 36 tsx scripts — FAILS (exit 1)

  `pnpm -r test` aborts in the server package. The suite bails at the first
  failing script, which varies run-to-run because several combat/timing tests
  are FLAKY (pass alone, fail under load): smoke.ts, equip.ts, mobCombat.ts.

  Running every server script directly reveals 7 reds:
    ⚠️ FLAKY        smoke.ts, equip.ts, mobCombat.ts
    ❌ FAIL (det.)  consumableUse.ts, party.ts, friends.ts, guild.ts
  The other 29 server scripts pass.
```

> `pnpm -r test` is RED until the flaky combat tests are stabilized and the four
> deterministic failures are fixed. Shared and client suites are green.

## Pre-Existing Known Issues

1. **Server test suite is RED / flaky** — `pnpm -r test` aborts in the server package. `smoke.ts`, `equip.ts`, and `mobCombat.ts` pass in isolation but fail intermittently under suite load (combat/timing-dependent). The suite bails at whichever flaky test loses the race, so the failure point varies run-to-run.
2. **Profanity filter over-masks** — `filterProfanity()` in `shared/profanity.ts` uses substring matching (not word-boundary), so "Hello" → "****o" (matches "hell"). This deterministically breaks whisper (`friends.ts`) and guild chat (`guild.ts`) tests. Real bug: respect word boundaries before public release.
3. **Consumable shop purchase rejected** — buying stackable HP potions via `BUY_FROM_SHOP` (qty 3) fails in `consumableUse.ts`. Deterministic regression in the shop buy path for stackables.
4. **Party leader reassignment** — when the leader disconnects, the party still reports 2 members instead of removing the leaver and reassigning leadership (`party.ts`).
5. **Skill damage in melee auto-attack** — MapRoom `tryAttack` hardcodes `skillDamagePercent: 100` for auto-attacks; dedicated `SKILL_CAST` now applies skill-specific damage %.
6. **Scroll system STUB** — `applyScroll()` / `ScrollDef` exist in shared but there is no `APPLY_SCROLL` message, drop source, or shop slot, so equipment scrolling is unreachable in play.
7. **Untested-but-wired systems** — Familiars, Runes, Treasure boxes, Titles, Exploration dispatch, LFG/Party Finder, Free Market MTS extensions (buy orders/auctions/bids/price history), Bonus Hunting, Moderation, and Settings sync have no automated coverage.
8. ~~**Scheduled transport not gated**~~ — **FIXED.** Scheduled portals (Crossway↔Skyhaven airship, Skyhaven↔Frosthold airship, etc.) now enforce boarding windows server-side. Players board during the 60-second window, see a live countdown banner, and are teleported together when the window closes. Fully automated test in `test/scheduledTransport.ts`.
9. **PQ puzzle solver** — `solve` objective type defined but `PartyQuestRoom` doesn't evaluate puzzle solving.
10. **TownRoom is legacy** — `MapRoom` supersedes it for all features.
11. **BEGINNER class stub** — only 2 skills, minimal combat stats.
